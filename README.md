# Regional_LiDAR_Processing
This repository stores all scripts developed for processing regional LiDAR data, contributing to the creation of the digital twin of forests in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Summary of the functionality of each script in this folder.

1. Preprocessing
This batch script is designed for pre-processing LiDAR point cloud data. 
It provides flexibility for users to choose from various pre-processing steps, including tiling, ground classification, noise filtering, normalization, and thinning.
It also extracts specified information from LAS INFO files into a spreadsheet.
To free up the space, intermediate results will be moved from the source directory to a designated disk while processing continues.
